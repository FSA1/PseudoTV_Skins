Please place current PseudoTV Live skins here and sort outdated skins under _Outdated/PseudoTV_Build?.

All skins must contain its own referenced media, no Kodi skin dependences.
Please fillout skin.xml, version numbers should match the PTVL build it was designed for.
Besure to fillout all skin.xml info, these files will be used for the upcoming skin manager.

Help Wanted:
Please update these skins found under _Outdated to work with the current build of PseudoTV Live, then move to the PTVL Skin folder.

Thank You
